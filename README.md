# ExistenZIA
The API that will change your existence !

## The idea
When designing an API, some may want to go for freedom and let people as free as possible regarding the way to implement it. The other way is to provide a more established API with abstract classes and even methods that are already implemented for you.

At ExistenZia we went the **second** way. 

We think **too much** freedom is actually putting the hassle of carefully threading a well designed interface on the developers. We think that establishing some mechanisms **ourselves** allows developers to **concentrate** on the most important part: **the modules**.   

It also **reduces** the **variety** of bugs that may appears and help to build a more **robust** community around a **common** logic.

## The actual thing

Nothing better than a cool schema to let you understand our vision of an HTTP server :
